## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality like server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **TypeScript:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- **Redux:** Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, commonly used with React for managing application state.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without having to leave your HTML.
- **Vite:** Vite is a fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports during development.
